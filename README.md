# Sound Source Localization Using Coincident Microphone Pair

## Overview
This project is dedicated to the development and simulation of an advanced sound source localization system utilizing a coincident microphone pair. The system is designed to accurately estimate the direction and distance of sound sources in various scenarios, optimizing sound source localization even in environments with multiple sources.

## Features
- **Sensor Planning and Control**: Implements dynamic adjustment of microphone angles based on sound source locations to optimize localization.
- **Multi-Source Handling**: Capable of handling and differentiating between multiple sound sources simultaneously.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the sensor planning, such as localization accuracy and response time.
- **Simulation Environment**: A comprehensive simulation environment for visualizing and testing the interactions between multiple sound sources and microphones.
